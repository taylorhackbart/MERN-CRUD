# MERN CRUD TEMPLATE

## Description
I have created a MERN CRUD template that pushes a simple text string to a Mongo Database. Once the text has been submitted, the form area clears and the text appears below the text box. It is a simple app that allows users to easily begin their React apps with routing set up to Robo3T(local) and MongoAtlas(deployed)

## Usage


## Installation
To use this image upload, one must install React and Mongoose. By running npm install in the command line, all dependencies should be installed in the correct package.JSON files to run this app.
